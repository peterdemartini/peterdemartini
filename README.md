I am just your friendly neighborhood programmer, with a wife, a kid and two big dogs. I'm currently working for [Terascope](http://terascope.io) building a [distrubuted processing system](https://github.com/terascope/teraslice) and data analytics/managment platform. In my past, I was one of the founders/enginners of Computes Inc, an engineer on the Octoblu platform at Citrix Systems, before that I was software consultant.
