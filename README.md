I am just your friendly neighborhood programmer, with a wife, a kid, two big dogs and a cat. I'm currently working for [Twilio Segment](http://segment.com). In the past, I was the lead engineer at [Terascope](http://terascope.io), I was one of the founders/enginners of [Computes Inc](https://computes.io), an engineer on the Octoblu platform at [Citrix Systems](https://www.citrix.com) and before that I was software consultant.
